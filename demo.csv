"3836.Don_Quixote","Don Quixote","","Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, John Rutherford (Translator), Roberto González Echevarría (Introduction)","3.88","Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances that he determines to become a knight-errant himself. In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray—he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants—Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.With its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has been generally recognized as the first modern novel. The book has been enormously influential on a host of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, ""just as some people read the Bible.""","English","9780142437230","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Spanish Literature', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'Spain', 'Humor', 'Classic Literature']","['Sancho Panza', 'Don Quijote de la Mancha']","Paperback","Penguin Classics","1023","Penguin Books","02/25/03","10/28/05","['Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards Nominee for Best Adaptation from Another Medium & Best Humor Publication (2014)', 'Βραβείο Λογοτεχνικής Μετάφρασης ΕΚΕΜΕΛ for Ισπανόφωνη Λογοτεχνία (2010)', 'Premio de traducción literaria Valle Inclán for John Rutherford (2002)']","209688","['72520', '66539', '48749', '15704', '6176']","90","['La Mancha (Spain)', 'Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain)', 'Spain']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546112331l/3836._SY475_.jpg","253824","2893",9.04
