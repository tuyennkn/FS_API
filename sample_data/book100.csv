The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and once girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","English","9780439023481","['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adventure', 'Teen', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Action']","['Katniss Everdeen', 'Peeta Mellark', 'Cato (Hunger Games)', 'Primrose Everdeen', 'Gale Hawthorne', 'Effie Trinket', 'Haymitch Abernathy', 'Cinna', 'President Coriolanus Snow', 'Rue', 'Flavius', 'Lavinia (Hunger Games)', 'Marvel', 'Glimmer', 'Clove', 'Foxface', 'Thresh', 'Greasy Sae', 'Madge Undersee', 'Caesar Flickerman', 'Claudius Templesmith', 'Octavia (Hunger Games)', 'Portia (hunger Games)']","Hardcover","First Edition","374","Scholastic Press","09/14/08","","['Locus Award Nominee for Best Young Adult Book (2009)', 'Georgia Peach Book Award (2009)', 'Buxtehuder Bulle (2009)', 'Golden Duck Award for Young Adult (Hal Clement Award) (2009)', ""Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire Nominee for Roman jeunesse étranger (2010)"", 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (2012)', ""West Australian Young Readers' Book Award (WAYRBA) for Older Readers (2010)"", ""Red House Children's Book Award for Older Readers & Overall (2010)"", 'South Carolina Book Award for Junior and Young Adult Book (2011)', 'Charlotte Award (2010)', 'Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award (2010)', 'Teen Buckeye Book Award (2009)', ""Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award for Young Adults (2010)"", 'Rhode Island Teen Book Award (2010)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award (2010)"", 'Evergreen Teen Book Award (2011)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2009)', 'Milwaukee County Teen Book Award Nominee (2010)', 'Sakura Medal for Middle School Book (2010)', 'Michigan Library Association Thumbs Up!

With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.","English","9780451526342","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Politics', 'School', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Read For School']","['Snowball', 'Napoleon', 'Clover', 'Boxer', 'Old Major', 'Muriel', 'Jones', 'Squealer', 'Moses the Raven', 'Benjamin']","Mass Market Paperback","","141","Signet Classics","04/28/96","08/17/45","['Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (2011)', 'Retro Hugo Award for Best Novella (1996)']","2740713","['986764', '958699', '545475', '165093', '84682']","91","['England', 'United Kingdom']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1325861570l/170448.jpg","1276599","13264",4.42

In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope—an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'France', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'French Literature', 'Romance', 'Classic Literature']","['Jean Valjean', 'Javert', 'Cosette', 'Fantine', 'Bishop Myriel', 'M. & Mme.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com","English","9780812550702","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']","['Dink', 'Bernard', 'Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Mazer Rackham', 'Alai', 'Hyrum Graff', 'Andrew Wiggin', 'Petra Arkanian', '""Bean""', 'Major Anderson', 'Bonzo', 'Major Imbu']","Audiobook","Unabridged","324","Macmillan Audio","09/30/04","10/28/85","['Hugo Award for Best Novel (1986)', 'Nebula Award for Best Novel (1985)', 'Nébula (1985)', 'Margaret A.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

Highly original and imaginative, this debut novel raises questions about life, love, and the effects of time on relationships.Audrey Niffenegger’s innovative debut, The Time Traveler’s Wife, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing. The Time Traveler’s Wife depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare’s marriage and their passionate love for each other as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals—steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.","English","9781939126016","['Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Magical Realism']","['Henry DeTamble', 'Clare Abshire', 'Gomez', 'Charisse', 'Richard DeTamble', 'Alicia Abshire', 'Mark Abshire', 'Philip Abshire', 'Lucille Abshire', 'Mrs. Kim', 'Alba DeTamble', 'Ingrid Carmichael', 'Celia Attley', 'Dr. David Kendrick']","ebook","Special Edition","500","Zola Books","09/23/13","07/05/03","['Arthur C.

"5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye","The Catcher in the Rye","","J.D. Salinger","3.81","The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","English","9780316769174","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Literature', 'School', 'Novels', 'Coming Of Age', 'American', 'High School', 'Read For School']","['Holden Caulfield', 'Robert Ackley', 'Stradlater', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B Caulfield', 'Sally Hayes', 'Holden Caufield', 'Robert Ackley', 'Stradlater', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B Caulfield', 'Sally Hayes']","Paperback","First Back Bay Paperback Edition (US/CAN)","277","Back Bay Books","01/30/01","07/16/51","['Teen Read Award Nominee for Best All-Time-Fave (2010)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1952)']","2736523","['937208', '846027', '579292', '234980', '139016']","86","['New York City, New York (United States)', 'Agerstown, Pennsylvania (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398034300l/5107.jpg","603268","6533",2.6

"2998.The_Secret_Garden","The Secret Garden","","Frances Hodgson Burnett","4.13","""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911.  The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity.  The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy.  The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance.

It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives—the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness—are inextricable from the history playing out around them.Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heart-wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love—a stunning accomplishment.--front flap","English","9781594489501","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'War', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Drama', 'Literature']","['Laila', 'Mariam', 'Rasheed', 'Tariq']","Hardcover","U.S. Edition","372","Riverhead Books","06/01/07","05/22/07","['British Book Award for Best Read of the Year (2008)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction (2008)', 'California Book Award for Fiction (Silver) (2007)', 'Exclusive Books Boeke Prize Nominee (2007)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2011)']","1151288","['624406', '376677', '119523', '21990', '8692']","97","['Afghanistan', 'Kabul (Afghanistan)', 'Herat (Afghanistan)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1345958969l/128029.jpg","580722","6164",1.16

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.source: georgerrmartin.com","English","9780553588484","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Dragons', 'Audiobook', 'Epic']","['Brandon Stark', 'Catelyn Stark', 'Tyrion Lannister', 'Daenerys Targaryen', 'Eddard Stark', 'Theon Greyjoy', 'Robb Stark', 'Arya Stark', 'Jaime Lannister', 'Joffrey Baratheon', 'Robert Baratheon', 'Tywin Lannister', 'Lysa Arryn', 'Petyr Baelish', 'Sansa Stark', 'Viserys Targaryen', 'Varys', 'Hodor', 'Beric Dondarrion', 'Thoros of Myr', 'Sandor Clegane', 'Samwell Tarly', 'Pyp', 'Tommen Baratheon', 'Stannis Baratheon', 'Grenn', 'Mace Tyrell', 'Septa Mordane', 'Jon Snow', 'Cersei Lannister', 'Jorah Mormont']","Mass Market Paperback","","835","Bantam","08/28/05","08/06/96","['Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (1997)', 'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Premio Ignotus for Novela extranjera (2003)']","2003043","['1231600', '540493', '156705', '41880', '32365']","96","['The Lands of Ice and Fire']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496.jpg","562241","6007",4.01

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for ""social"") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

"1381.The_Odyssey","The Odyssey","","Homer, Robert Fagles (Translator), Bernard Knox (Introduction)","3.77","Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turnsdriven time and again off course, once he had plunderedthe hallowed heights of Troy.So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey, which Jasper Griffin in The New York Times Review of Books hails as ""a distinguished achievement.""If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.--Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.","English","9780143039952","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Read For School', 'Historical Fiction']","['Odysseus', 'Penelope (wife of Odysseus)', 'Helen of Troy', 'Achilles (Greek hero)', 'Telemachus', 'Minerva', 'Polyphemus', 'Agamemnon']","Paperback","","541","Penguin Classics","11/30/06","10/28/00","[]","861486","['265910', '274273', '213021', '74221', '34061']","87","['Ithaca (Greece)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390173285l/1381.jpg","494442","5437",3.65

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","English","9999999999999","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Medieval', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Adult']","['Thomas Becket', 'Henry II of England', 'Tom Builder', 'Prior Philip', 'Aliena', 'Jack Jackson', 'Stephen of England', 'Empress Matilda', 'William Hamleigh', 'Ellen', 'Richard of Kingsbridge', 'Alfred Builder', 'Waleran Bigod', 'Lord Percy Hamleigh', 'Lady Regan Hamleigh', 'Remigius']","Paperback","","976","NAL Trade","02/04/02","10/28/89","[]","648793","['354788', '189091', '71541', '21183', '12190']","95","['England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043.jpg","392260","4221",""

While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing.

Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable.

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.","English","9780307265432","['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Classics', 'Horror', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Apocalyptic', 'Contemporary']","['The man', 'The boy']","Hardcover","First U.S. Edition","241","Alfred A.

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.","English","9780007205233","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Ireland', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Irish Literature', 'Historical']","['Frank McCourt']","Paperback","","452","Harper Perennial","10/03/05","09/05/96","['Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography (1997)', 'American Booksellers Book Of The Year  Award for Adult Trade (1997)', 'Audie Award for Nonfiction, Abridged (1997)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography (1996)', 'Exclusive Books Boeke Prize (1997)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography/Autobiography (1996)']","539576","['224972', '193782', '88173', '22464', '10185']","94","['Limerick (Ireland)', 'New York State (United States)', 'Ireland']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348317139l/252577.jpg","290485","3242",2.76

But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer.

"43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire","Interview with the Vampire","The Vampire Chronicles #1","Anne Rice","4.00","This is the story of Louis, as told in his own words, of his journey through mortal and immortal life. Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even ""settle down"" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com","English","9780345476876","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural', 'Classics', 'Gothic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction']","['Lestat de Lioncourt', 'Claudia', 'Daniel Molloy', 'Louis de Pointe du Lac']","Paperback","","342","Ballantine Books","08/31/04","04/12/76","['British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1977)']","484530","['180566', '167133', '100554', '26802', '9475']","93","['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)', 'Paris (France)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642l/43763.jpg","208415","2388",2.66

A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it."" So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, Moby-Dick is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.This edition of Moby-Dick, which reproduces the definitive text of the novel, includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a glossary of nautical terms.","English","9780142437247","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'American', 'Classic Literature', '19th Century', 'Unfinished']","['Elijah', 'Stubb', 'Captain Ahab', 'Ishmael', 'Queequeg', 'Starbuck', 'Tashtego', 'Dough-boy', 'Flask', 'Daggoo', 'Fedallah', 'Pippin (""Pip"")', 'Moby Dick', 'Mapple Priest', 'Peleg', 'Bildad', 'Fleece', 'Perth', 'Peter Coffin', 'Aunt Charity', 'Mrs Hussey']","Paperback","","654","Penguin Classics","02/21/03","10/18/51","['Audie Award for Solo Narration - Male (2006)', 'Премія імені Максима Рильського (1991)']","479125","['129483', '125817', '122379', '60815', '40631']","79","['Nantucket Island, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'New Bedford, Massachusetts (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327940656l/153747.jpg","202669","2346",1.87

Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood—the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers—Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah—the four wives of Jacob.

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale?
