"3836.Don_Quixote","Don Quixote","","Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, John Rutherford (Translator), Roberto Gonz?lez Echevarr?a (Introduction)","3.88","Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances that he determines to become a knight-errant himself. In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray?he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants?Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.With its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has been generally recognized as the first modern novel. The book has been enormously influential on a host of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, ""just as some people read the Bible.""","English","9780142437230","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Spanish Literature', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'Spain', 'Humor', 'Classic Literature']","['Sancho Panza', 'Don Quijote de la Mancha']","Paperback","Penguin Classics","1023","Penguin Books","02/25/03","10/28/05","['Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards Nominee for Best Adaptation from Another Medium & Best Humor Publication (2014)', '??????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? for ?????????? ??????????

"662.Atlas_Shrugged","Atlas Shrugged","","Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff (Goodreads Author) (Introduction)","3.69","This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators?Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world?s motor ? and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life ? from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy ? to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction ? to the philosopher who becomes a pirate ? to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph ? to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad ? to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.This is a mystery story, not about the murder ? and rebirth ? of man?s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, that is the first of your premises to check.","English","9780452011878","['Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Politics', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Economics', 'Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Fiction']","['Prometheus (mythology)', 'Atlas', 'Dagny Taggart', 'John Galt', 'Hank Rearden', ""Francisco d'Anconia"", 'James Taggart']","Paperback","","1168","Plume","08/01/99","10/28/57","['Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (1983)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1958)']","353814","['127162', '93644', '63882', '32760', '36366']","80","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405868167l/662.jpg","248484","2730","4.41"

(Illustrator)","4.57","Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.--scholastic.com","English","9780439655484","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Adventure', 'Middle Grade', 'Audiobook', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']","['Sirius Black', 'Draco Malfoy', 'Ron Weasley', 'Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley', 'Dudley Dursley', 'Severus Snape', 'Rubeus Hagrid', 'Minerva McGonagall', 'Neville Longbottom', 'Fred Weasley', 'George Weasley', 'Percy Weasley', 'Ginny Weasley', 'Colin Creevey', 'Filius Flitwick', 'Pomona Sprout', 'Arthur Weasley', 'Molly Weasley', 'Cho Chang', 'Marjorie Dursley', 'Cornelius Fudge', 'Remus Lupin', 'Sybil Trelawney', 'Peter Pettigrew', 'Poppy Pomfrey', 'Stan Shunpike', 'Oliver Wood', 'Cedric Diggory', 'Dean Thomas', 'Seamus Finnigan', 'Rolanda Hooch', 'Katie Bell', 'Ernie Prang', 'Albus Dumbledore', 'Harry Potter', 'Hermione Granger']","Mass Market Paperback","","435","Scholastic Inc.","05/01/04","07/08/99","['Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers (1999)', 'Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel (2000)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2000)', ""Whitbread Award for Children's Book of the Year (1999)"", ""Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature (2008)"", 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (2005)', 'Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award (2004)', 'Maine Student Book Award (2001)', 'Golden Archer Award for Intermediate (2001)', 'Indian Paintbrush Book Award (2004)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2002)', 'Hotze de Roosprijs (2001)', 'Nestl?

"43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire","Interview with the Vampire","The Vampire Chronicles #1","Anne Rice","4.00","This is the story of Louis, as told in his own words, of his journey through mortal and immortal life. Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even ""settle down"" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com","English","9780345476876","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural', 'Classics', 'Gothic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction']","['Lestat de Lioncourt', 'Claudia', 'Daniel Molloy', 'Louis de Pointe du Lac']","Paperback","","342","Ballantine Books","08/31/04","04/12/76","['British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1977)']","484530","['180566', '167133', '100554', '26802', '9475']","93","['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)', 'Paris (France)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642l/43763.jpg","208415","2388","2.66"
