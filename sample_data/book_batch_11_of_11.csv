"153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale","Moby-Dick or, the Whale","","Herman Melville, Andrew Delbanco (Introduction), Tom Quirk (Notes), Rockwell Kent (Illustrator)","3.51","""It is the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it."" So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, Moby-Dick is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.This edition of Moby-Dick, which reproduces the definitive text of the novel, includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a glossary of nautical terms.","English","9780142437247","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'American', 'Classic Literature', '19th Century', 'Unfinished']","['Elijah', 'Stubb', 'Captain Ahab', 'Ishmael', 'Queequeg', 'Starbuck', 'Tashtego', 'Dough-boy', 'Flask', 'Daggoo', 'Fedallah', 'Pippin (""Pip"")', 'Moby Dick', 'Mapple Priest', 'Peleg', 'Bildad', 'Fleece', 'Perth', 'Peter Coffin', 'Aunt Charity', 'Mrs Hussey']","Paperback","","654","Penguin Classics","02/21/03","10/18/51","['Audie Award for Solo Narration - Male (2006)', '?????? ????? ??????? ??????????

"4989.The_Red_Tent","The Red Tent","","Anita Diamant (Goodreads Author)","4.18","Her name is Dinah. In the Bible, her life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis that are about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood?the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers?Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah?the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting, The Red Tent combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of biblical women's society.","English","9780312353766","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Religion', 'Book Club', 'Feminism', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Womens', 'Novels']","['Isaac (Bible)', 'Dinah (Bible)', 'Jacob (Bible)']","Hardcover","","324","St. Martin's Press","10/28/97","10/28/97","['Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction (2001)', ""Boston Author's Club Award (1998)""]","520252","['244051', '167546', '76133', '21830', '10692']","94","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405739117l/4989.jpg","181001","2025","5.26"

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal?and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.","English","9780312330873","['Mystery', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Suspense', 'Novels']","['Justice Lawrence John Wargrave', 'Vera Elizabeth Claythorne', 'Philip Lombard', 'General John Gordon Macarthur', 'Dr Edward George Armstrong', 'Anthony James Marston', 'William Henry Blore', 'Mr Thomas Rogers', 'Mrs Ethel Rogers', 'Emily Caroline Brent', 'Isaac Morris', 'Fred Narracott']","Paperback","","264","St. Martin's Press","05/03/04","11/06/39","[]","822061","['406760', '271535', '108660', '22118', '12988']","96","['United Kingdom', 'Devon Coast, England (United Kingdom)', 'Devon, England']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391120695l/16299.jpg","161480","1876","4.82"
