In his world, where television rules and literature is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than put them out.

But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people did not live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television.When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.","English","B0064CPN7I","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'School', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']","['Guy Montag', 'Norman Corwin', 'Clarisse McClellan', 'Mildred Montag', 'Captain Beatty', 'Professor Faber']","Kindle Edition","60th Anniversary Edition","194","Simon & Schuster","11/29/11","10/19/53","['Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (1984)', 'Geffen Award for Best Translated SF Book (2002)', 'California Book Award for Fiction (Silver) (1953)', 'Retro Hugo Award for Best Novel (2004)']","1680139","['612098', '604888', '331815', '91160', '40178']","92","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383718290l/13079982.jpg","793757","8537",""

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives.

So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are?and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.","English","9780062024039","['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adventure', 'Teen', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Action']","['Albert', 'Drew Leighton (Divergent)', 'Eric (Divergent)', 'Beatrice Prior', 'Peter', 'Caleb Prior', 'Natalie Prior', 'Molly Atwood', 'Christina', 'Jeanine Matthews', 'Marcus Eaton', 'Tobias Eaton']","Paperback","","487","Katherine Tegen Books","02/28/12","04/25/11","['Georgia Peach Book Award (2012)', 'South Carolina Book Award for Young Adult (2014)', 'Rhode Island Teen Book Award (2013)', 'Evergreen Teen Book Award (2014)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2012)', 'Milwaukee County Teen Book Award Nominee (2012)', ""Children's Choice Book Award Nominee for Teen Choice Book of the Year (2012)"", 'Sakura Medal', 'New Mexico Land of Enchantment Award for Young Adult (2014)', 'Eliot Rosewater Indiana High School Book Award (2014)', 'California Young Readers Medal for Young Adult (2014)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2014)', 'DABWAHA Romance Tournament for Best Young Adult Romance (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Favorite Book and for Young Adult Fantasy & Science Fiction and Nominee for Goodreads Author (2011)', 'Green Mountain Book Award (2013)', 'The Magnolia Award for 6-8 (2014)', ""Louisiana Teen Readers' Choice (2014)"", 'Missouri Gateway Readers Award (2014)', 'Oklahoma Sequoyah Award for High Schol (2014)', 'Premio El Templo de las Mil Puertas Nominee for Mejor novela extranjera perteneciente a saga (2011)']","2906258","['1409189', '882493', '434381', '123286', '56909']","94","['Chicago, Illinois (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1588455221l/13335037._SY475_.jpg","793269","8339","0.88"
"7624.Lord_of_the_Flies","Lord of the Flies","","William Golding","3.69","At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about ?the end of innocence, the darkness of man?s heart.?","English","9780140283334","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'School', 'Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'Adventure']","['Ralph', 'Piggy', 'Roger', 'Jack Merridew', 'Simon']","Paperback","Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century","182","Penguin Books","10/01/99","09/17/54","[]","2263259","['617568', '763438', '555614', '205804', '120835']","86","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327869409l/7624.jpg","773560","8230","1.89"

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com","English","9780812550702","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']","['Dink', 'Bernard', 'Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Mazer Rackham', 'Alai', 'Hyrum Graff', 'Andrew Wiggin', 'Petra Arkanian', '""Bean""', 'Major Anderson', 'Bonzo', 'Major Imbu']","Audiobook","Unabridged","324","Macmillan Audio","09/30/04","10/28/85","['Hugo Award for Best Novel (1986)', 'Nebula Award for Best Novel (1985)', 'N?bula (1985)', 'Margaret A.
