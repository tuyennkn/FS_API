"4667024-the-help","The Help","","Kathryn Stockett (Goodreads Author)","4.47","Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereThree ordinary women are about to take one extraordinary step.Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream -- a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California?s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America?s lonely and dispossessed, Of Mice and Men has proved one of Steinbeck?s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.","English","9780142000670","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'American', 'Classic Literature']","['George Milton', 'Lennie Small', 'Candy', 'Curley', ""Curley's Wife"", 'Slim', 'Crooks', 'Whit', 'Carlson']","Paperback","Steinbeck Centennial Edition, US / CAN Edition","103","Penguin Books","01/08/02","10/28/37","[""New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best American Play (1938)""]","1942168","['634457', '681382', '437709', '132901', '55719']","90","['Salinas Valley, California (United States)', 'California (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302904l/890._SX318_.jpg","667925","7218","5.75"

Highly original and imaginative, this debut novel raises questions about life, love, and the effects of time on relationships.Audrey Niffenegger?s innovative debut, The Time Traveler?s Wife, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing. The Time Traveler?s Wife depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare?s marriage and their passionate love for each other as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals?steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.","English","9781939126016","['Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Magical Realism']","['Henry DeTamble', 'Clare Abshire', 'Gomez', 'Charisse', 'Richard DeTamble', 'Alicia Abshire', 'Mark Abshire', 'Philip Abshire', 'Lucille Abshire', 'Mrs. Kim', 'Alba DeTamble', 'Ingrid Carmichael', 'Celia Attley', 'Dr. David Kendrick']","ebook","Special Edition","500","Zola Books","09/23/13","07/05/03","['Arthur C.
