"1381.The_Odyssey","The Odyssey","","Homer, Robert Fagles (Translator), Bernard Knox (Introduction)","3.77","Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turnsdriven time and again off course, once he had plunderedthe hallowed heights of Troy.So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey, which Jasper Griffin in The New York Times Review of Books hails as ""a distinguished achievement.""If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.--Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.","English","9780143039952","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Read For School', 'Historical Fiction']","['Odysseus', 'Penelope (wife of Odysseus)', 'Helen of Troy', 'Achilles (Greek hero)', 'Telemachus', 'Minerva', 'Polyphemus', 'Agamemnon']","Paperback","","541","Penguin Classics","11/30/06","10/28/00","[]","861486","['265910', '274273', '213021', '74221', '34061']","87","['Ithaca (Greece)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390173285l/1381.jpg","494442","5437","3.65"
