"6514.The_Bell_Jar","The Bell Jar","","Sylvia Plath","4.01","The Bell Jar chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under?maybe for the last time. Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Feminism', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology', 'Mental Illness', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Poetry', 'Adult']","['Constantin', 'Esther Greenwood', 'Valerie', 'Marco', 'Mrs. Greenwood', 'Buddy Willard', 'Doctor Nolan', 'Joan Gilling', 'Jay Cee', 'Betsy', 'Irwin', 'Doctor Gordon', 'Philomena Guinea', 'Mrs. Willard', 'Lenny Shepherd', 'Dodo Conway', 'Eric', 'Doreen']","Paperback","First Harper Perennial Modern Classics Deluxe Edition (US)","294","Harper Perennial Modern Classics","10/28/06","01/28/63","[]","591175","['215731', '217154', '117286', '30249', '10755']","93","['Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'New York City, New York (United States)']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1554582218l/6514._SY475_.jpg","351517","3860",""

But her regime is disrupted by the arrival of McMurphy ? the swaggering, fun-loving trickster with a devilish grin who resolves to oppose her rules on behalf of his fellow inmates. His struggle is seen through the eyes of Chief Bromden, a seemingly mute half-Indian patient who understands McMurphy's heroic attempt to do battle with the powers that keep them imprisoned.

In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch. As Rosemary Edmonds comments, 'He leaves the shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope to bring home the meaning of the brooding words following the title, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.","English","9999999999999","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Russia', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Russian Literature', 'Novels', '19th Century', 'Classic Literature']","['Princess Ekaterina ""Kitty"" Aleksandrovna Shcherbatskaya', 'Anna Arkadyevna Karenina', 'Count Aleksei Kirillovich Vronsky', 'Konstantin ""Kostya"" Dmitrievitch Levin', 'Prince Stepan ""Stiva"" Arkadyevitch Oblonsky']","Paperback","Movie Tie-In Edition","964","Vintage","10/16/12","10/28/77","['PEN Translation Prize for Richard Pevear & Larissa Volokhonsky (2002)']","681953","['283318', '223682', '120596', '36847', '17510']","92","['Russia']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1601352433l/15823480._SY475_.jpg","348162","3815",""

At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings.","English","9780141301068","['Childrens', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Middle Grade', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Juvenile']","['Matilda Wormwood', 'Miss Honey', 'Miss Trunchbull']","Paperback","","240","Puffin Books","06/01/98","10/01/88","['Odyssey Award Nominee (2014)', 'Prijs van de Nederlandse Kinderjury for 10-12 jaar en 13-16 jaar (1989)', ""Audie Award for Children's Titles Ages 8-12 (2014)"", 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Read Aloud (1990), Younger Readers (1997) (1990)', ""West Australian Young Readers' Book Award (WAYRBA) for Younger Readers (1989)"", ""Blue Peter Book Award for Voter's Award - Book that Made Me Laugh the Loudest (2000)"", ""Red House Children's Book Award (1989)"", 'Maryland Black-Eyed Susan Book Award for Book Award (1992)', ""Massachusetts Children's Book Award (1992)"", ""Nevada Young Readers' Award for Intermediate Category  (1992)"", ""Beehive Book Award for Children's Fiction (1991)"", 'Indian Paintbrush Book Award (1991)', 'Bluestem Book Award Nominee (2016)', ""Virginia Reader's Choice for Elementary (1990)"", ""Rebecca Caudill Young Readers' Book Award (1991)""]","647667","['340257', '203271', '82637', '14606', '6896']","97","['United Kingdom']","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388793265l/39988.jpg","339882","3789","6.01"
