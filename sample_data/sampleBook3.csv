He’s nothing like her abusive stepfather—in other words, he’s sweet. But the closer they get, the more Nathan wants of her time, of her love, of her...and the less she wants to give. As Rae’s affection for Nathan turns to fear, she leans on her friend Leo for support. With Leo, she feels lighter, happier. And possessive Nathan becomes jealous. Then a tragedy lands Rae in the ICU.

"43719900-samson","Samson: The Modern Day America","","Stephen R. Williams (Goodreads Author)","5.00","This book begins with the story of Samson, the only person in the Bible to hold incredible physical strength. He was born to live a life of service to the Lord, ordained by God to be a Nazirite, and destined to judge and rule the Philistines. Samson's life is then compared to the powerful country of America, which was once a nation of people seeking a place of worship and service to God. Through time, both Samson and America acquired power that any entity would want. However, a common weakness leads them both to destruction. Discover the cause of a great man's fall and its shocking similarity to the struggle of a powerful country. Backed with Biblical scriptures, Samson: The Modern-Day America is a book that holds nothing short of the key to a struggling country's redemption.","","9999999999999","['Tôn_giáo✝️混合', 'Bi8lical-Christian-基督教', 'Non~fiction??', 'Lịch_sử/History/歷史', 'Chính_trị-Politics-政治', 'Phi_hư_cấu', 'Tâm linh spirituality روحانية', 'Triết học???Philosophy', 'AmericanStudies美國研究', 'SocialCommentary', 'Cultural-văn_hóa-文化', 'Religious-Theology神學', 'Biography(???)', 'Inspirational-Truyền cảm hứng']","[]","","","110","Toplink Publishing, LLC","March 1st 2018","07/27/09","[]","2","[]","100","[]","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548606081l/43719900._SY475_.jpg","100","1",""
"43710654-nothing-more-to-take","Nothing More to Take","Give & Take Duet #1","Demetra Georgiou (Goodreads Author)","4.24","Can love survive amidst lies, schemes and subterfuge? Zac, a man accustomed to getting what he wants, seeks retribution on behalf of the only father figure he's known, even though no one asked him to.""I still can't believe how an ethereal being like Diane can be a plotting bitch. Why the old man held her in such a high regard, is beyond me. She is ungrateful and someone needs to teach her a thing or two. And I have the only right to do so."" Evidence and reports condemn the woman he purposefully set to 'teach a lesson', but the truth has a way of creeping out of the most unlikely corners. ""She looked at me in the eyes and told me, but I didn't believe her... She lay there with trust in her eyes and let me do that to her and more.""One mistake after the other and one fight too many bring them closer to the end. All it takes is three little words to take down his whole house of cards. Now Zac has to trust the only woman who had the tenacity to see beyond his scowls and cold behaviour and not because she was innocent all along. “Her name is Diane. The woman who has made my heart beating.""Warning: This book contains themes intended for mature audiences only.
